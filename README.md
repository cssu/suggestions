<h2> About </h2>
This is a repository used to store suggestions made by students, faculty, and other members of the Computer Science Student Union. We've chosen GitHub to store suggestions, using Issues, as it allows for public visibility of suggestions which have been made to users, and to improve accountability - ensuring that members' suggestions do not go unheard or unnoticed. </br>
</br>
Executives have the ability to respond to suggestions by commenting on them, and then closing them as needed. You are more than welcome to make a suggestion <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezHTUUDzEp7cL84h4Ap-NI_dgPanElq2Xkf-Nulrn38qd0CA/viewform">here.</a>
